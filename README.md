# Problem Description: Sentiment Analysis Solution for Kenya Airways
# Background: 
Kenya Airways is looking to improve its overall travel experience by analyzing customer feedback from social media and travel review sites. Your task is to develop a sentiment analysis solution that scrapes relevant data, processes it, and provides insights into customer sentiments regarding the airline's services.

# Objective: 
You are required to develop a system that scrapes social media platforms and travel review sites for mentions of Kenya Airways, performs sentiment analysis on the collected data, and presents the findings in a user-friendly manner.

# Instructions:
    1. Repository Setup:
        ◦ Fork the provided GitHub repository containing the problem description.
        ◦ Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
    2. Branching:
        ◦ Create a new branch from the main branch named feature/sentiment-analysis.
    3. Implementation:
        ◦ Data Scraping: Implement a solution that scrapes data from at least two social media platforms and one travel review site for mentions of Kenya Airways.
        ◦ Sentiment Analysis: Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiments expressed in the scraped data. The analysis should categorize sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral.
        ◦ Data Pipeline: Design a data pipeline that automates the scraping, analysis, and storage of results.
        ◦ System Design: Consider how your system handles scalability, error handling, and system security (e.g., API key management, rate limiting).
        ◦ Frontend Development: Build a simple dashboard that displays the sentiment analysis results. It should include visualizations like charts or graphs that provide insights into customer sentiments over time.
        ◦ Backend Development: Develop the backend API that handles the data scraping, processing, and serves the analyzed data to the frontend.
        ◦ User Experience: Ensure that the dashboard is user-friendly, with a focus on clarity and ease of navigation.
    4. Documentation:
        ◦ Clearly document your code and provide a README.md file that explains how to set up and run your solution.
        ◦ Include instructions for how to use the data scraping and sentiment analysis features, and describe any assumptions or limitations of your solution.
    5. Submission:
        ◦ Push your branch feature/sentiment-analysis to the forked GitHub repository.
        ◦ Create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the main branch in the forked repository.
        ◦ Attach any relevant documentation, links, or notes to the PR.
        ◦ Send a short video clip (maximum 5 minutes) via WhatsApp, explaining your work and demonstrating how to use your solution. The video should be submitted by 11:00 AM on the submission day.
    6. Evaluation Criteria:
        ◦ Version Control: Proper use of Git branching, commits, and pull requests.
        ◦ Data Pipeline: Robustness and efficiency of the data scraping and sentiment analysis pipeline.
        ◦ System Design: Scalability, security, and overall architecture of the solution.
        ◦ Frontend/Backend Development: Quality, functionality, and user experience of the dashboard and backend API.
        ◦ Documentation: Clarity, thoroughness, and organization of the documentation.
        ◦ Presentation: Clarity and conciseness of the video explanation.
